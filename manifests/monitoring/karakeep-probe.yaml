# Blackbox HTTP probe for Karakeep
# Phase 4.24: Monitor Karakeep health endpoint availability
#
# How it works:
#   Prometheus -> Blackbox Exporter -> GET http://karakeep.karakeep.svc:3000/api/health -> Karakeep
#   If health check fails -> probe_success=0 -> Alert fires
#
# Target is internal ClusterIP — blackbox exporter reaches it via cluster DNS
