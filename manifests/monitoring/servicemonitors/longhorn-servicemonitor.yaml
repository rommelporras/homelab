# ServiceMonitor for Longhorn
# Phase 4.28: Enable Prometheus scraping of Longhorn volume health metrics
#
# Currently NOT scraped — this adds longhorn_volume_robustness and related metrics.
# Without this, degraded/faulted volumes are invisible to Prometheus.
#
# Service: longhorn-backend in longhorn-system (port 9500, port name: manager)
# Scrape interval: 60s (volume health doesn't change rapidly)
